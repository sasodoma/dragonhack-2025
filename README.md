## About the project
For DragonHack 2025, our team Pi≈°kotki is developing a Bluetooth-enabled Braille display designed to interface seamlessly with a mobile application. The display receives character data from the app in real time, allowing users to physically feel and recognize Braille letters through tactile feedback. The accompanying mobile app serves as an educational platform, guiding users step-by-step through the Braille alphabet and offering interactive exercises to support learning and retention. Users can also press the Braille pins themselves, enabling the app to detect and interpret their input. This interactive loop supports both passive learning and active practice.
